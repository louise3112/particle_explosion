# Particle Fire Explosion
A simulation of a particle fire explosion developed in C++ using the SDL2 library as a GUI.

This project was completed following the final tutorial of an [Introduction to C++ course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/learn/lecture/1747908#overview) which I was completing in preparation for a job interview. I found working through this project was a great way to consolidate my learning whilst producing something that looks pretty cool!

I really enjoyed the incremental approach which helped me to visualise what was being acheived at each stage - so much so I collated videos of each key stage and compiled them into a [progress video](https://youtu.be/Lp6_RpcIj0E)!
